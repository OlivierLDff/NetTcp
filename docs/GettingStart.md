# ðŸš€ Quick Start

This library have 3 main classes:

* `Server`: Listen for incoming connection from a client. Create a new socket for each client.
* `Socket`: Allow to send data and receive data from a client. Or to connect to server and send/receive data.
* `SocketWorker`: Object that actually handle data stream and is supposed to reconstruct from it. This object can live in a worker thread to do deserialization work.

The library won't do much out of the box. Inheritance from those class is required. The goal of this library is to provide easy to use object with all the required functionality to only focus on data transmission.

## Custom Protocol for example

Most of the time when using TCP, a custom packet protocol needs to be implemented. In the following example, the protocol used will be very simple. The protocol goal is to send strings.

First byte will be header, and will indicate the length of the string. Maximum string length is 128. The string will follow. Data stream will look like that:

![DataStream.svg](./DataStream.svg)

The header + payload stream structure is the most efficient way to transmit data because depending on the protocol (if packet size is known, or packet size have a limit), one or two read is only necessary to retrieve a full packet.

## Create a Client

Creating a client is the easiest way to start, because only `Socket` and `SocketWorker` needs to be customize.

### Socket Worker

Let's start by implementing a custom `SocketWorker`.

* Inherit from `net::tcp::SocketWorker`.
  * It's a QObject, so don't forget the Q_OBJECT macro.
* Override `void onDataAvailable()`. This function will be called each time new data is available to poll.
  * This function run in the worker thread. It' can either be a thread created by owning `Server`, or `Server` thread.
  * Call `size_t bytesAvailable()` to know how many bytes are in system buffer.
  * Call `size_t read(uint8_t* buffer, size_t max)` to read at maximum `max` bytes. The function return the real number of byte read.
  * If any problem happened call `closeAndRestart()`. Socket will try to restart later.
    * If the owning `Socket` have been created as a client, then it will reconnect to remote server later.
    * If the owning `Socket` have been created by a `Server`, the `Socket` will be completely destroy. It's the client responsibility to reconnect.
* Call `size_t write(const uint8_t* buffer, const size_t length)` to write data to the stream. The function returned the number of byte written. If byte written is 0 then retry later. Every buffer are full.
* **Don't forget to reset the *State Machine* when server disconnect or reconnect.**

The example is self explanatory.

* The function that write the data first write the header then write the payload (the string)
* The function that read wait for a header to read. Then poll every possible byte until the full string got read.
* Custom signals & slots are present to communicate with `Socket`.

```cpp
class MySocketWorker : public net::tcp::SocketWorker
{
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    MySocketWorker(QObject* parent = nullptr) : net::tcp::SocketWorker(parent) {}

private:
    bool waitingForData = false;
    uint8_t buffer[128] = {};
    uint8_t bufferLength = 0;
    uint8_t expectedSize = 0;

    void readHeader()
    {
        // Only read if something is available
        if (!bytesAvailable())
            return;

        // Only read if in correct state
        if (waitingForData)
            return;

        // Read 1 byte
        if (!read(&expectedSize, 1))
            return closeAndRestart();

        // Check header is valid
        if (expectedSize == 0 || expectedSize >= 128)
            return closeAndRestart();

        // Go to next state waiting for data
        waitingForData = true;
    }

protected Q_SLOTS:
    // !! DONT FORGET TO RELEASE BUFFER !! IMPORTANT !! //
    void onConnected() override final
    {
        net::tcp::SocketWorker::onConnected();
        waitingForData = false;
        bufferLength = 0;
    }
    void onDataAvailable() override final
    {
        // Read header if not done
        if (!waitingForData)
            readHeader();

        // Otherwise read maximum number of bytes expected
        while(waitingForData && bytesAvailable())
        {
            // Read maximum data until the whole packet have been read.
            const auto bytesRead = read(buffer + bufferLength, expectedSize - bufferLength);
            bufferLength += uint8_t(bytesRead);

            // Emit the received string when read is complete
            if(bufferLength == expectedSize)
            {
                QString s(reinterpret_cast<char*>(buffer));
                Q_EMIT stringAvailable(s);
                waitingForData = false;
                bufferLength = 0;
                readHeader();
            }
        }
    }

public Q_SLOTS:
    void onSendString(const QString& s)
    {
        const auto data = s.toStdString();
        // Max packet size is 128
        if (data.length() >= 128)
            return;

        uint8_t size = uint8_t(data.length() + 1);
        // Write header
        if (!write(&size, 1))
            return closeAndRestart();
        // Write data
        if (!write(data.c_str(), size))
            return closeAndRestart();
    }
Q_SIGNALS:
    void stringAvailable(const QString& s);
};
```

### Create Socket

Now let's implement a custom `Socket`. It will be responsible of:

* Sending string to the worker
* Receiving string from the worker
* Create the wanted custom worker by overriding `std::unique_ptr<net::tcp::SocketWorker> createWorker()`.

```cpp
class MySocket : public net::tcp::Socket
{
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    MySocket(QObject* parent = nullptr) : net::tcp::Socket(parent) {}

protected:
    std::unique_ptr<net::tcp::SocketWorker> createWorker() override
    {
        auto worker = std::make_unique<MySocketWorker>();

        // Send string to worker
        connect(this, &MySocket::sendString, worker.get(), &MySocketWorker::onSendString);

        // Receive string from worker
        connect(worker.get(), &MySocketWorker::stringAvailable, this, &MySocket::stringReceived);

        return std::move(worker);
    }

Q_SIGNALS:
    void sendString(const QString& s);
    void stringReceived(const QString& s);
};
```

### Start the client

```cpp
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    QCoreApplication app(argc, argv);
    MySocket client;
    client.start("127.0.0.1", 9999);
    client.sendString("My String");
    return QCoreApplication::exec();
}
```

If anything fail in the connection or during an exchange, a watchdog will try to reconnect to server.

* You can customize the watchdog with `bool setWatchdogPeriod(const quint64& ms)`.
* Or call `restart` to force a restart before watchdog end.

## Create a Server

Let's create a custom server than can receive strings for multiple clients. Because packet formatting is the same than on client side, let's reuse `MySocketWorker`. Let's also reuse `MySocket` that can already send and receive strings.

### Create a custom Server

Let's create a `MyServer` that create `MySocket` for each client that connect. When a string is received by the server, the message is echoed to the client.

* Override `net::tcp::AbstractSocket* newTcpSocket(QObject* parent)` to create a new socket each time a client connects.
* Override `bool canAcceptNewClient()` to give condition to accept a client.

```cpp
class MyServer : public net::tcp::Server
{
    Q_OBJECT
protected:
    net::tcp::AbstractSocket* newTcpSocket(QObject* parent) override
    {
        const auto s = new MySocket(parent);
        connect(s, &MySocket::stringReceived, [this, s](const QString& string)
            {
                qInfo("RX \"%s\" from client %s:%d", qPrintable(string), qPrintable(s->peerAddress()), signed(s->peerPort()));
                Q_EMIT s->sendString(string);
            });
        return s;
    }

    bool canAcceptNewClient() const
    {
        if(!::net::tcp::Server::canAcceptNewClient())
            return false;

        // Do your business here
        return true;
    }
};
```

Then simply start the server by giving the port that it needs to listen to.

```cpp
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    QCoreApplication app(argc, argv);
    MyServer server;
    server.start(9999);
    return QCoreApplication::exec();
}
```

By default the server will listen on any interface. It's also possible to listen only a specified interface by calling `bool start(const QString& address, const quint16 port)`.

A watchdog will take care a rebinding to the interface/port if something failed.

* You can customize the watchdog with `bool setWatchdogPeriod(const quint64& ms)`.

### React to Server

It's possible to react to multiple signals from the `Server`.

* `isListeningChanged` tell if the Server is correctly listening to `port` and `address`.
* `void acceptError(int error, const QString description)` indicate an error occured with  a client connection.
* `void newClient(const QString& address, const quint16 port)` tell when a new client is connected
* `void clientLost(const QString& address, const quint16 port);` tell when a client got disconnected

## Handle Logs

**NetTcp** library use `spdlog` as a logging backend. To listen to logs, you need to install `spdlog::sink`. The `registerSink` function needs to be called before any logs.

```cpp
// ...
#include <spdlog/sinks/stdout_color_sinks.h>
// ... Log NetTcp to stdout
const auto sink = std::make_shared<spdlog::sinks::stdout_color_sink_mt>();
net::tcp::Logger::registerSink(sink);
// ...
```

`NetTcp` use 4 main category:

* `net.tcp.server` : Log from `net::tcp::Server` objects
* `net.tcp.socket` : Log from `net::tcp::Socket` objects
* `net.tcp.socket.worker` : Log from `net::tcp::SocketWorker` objects
* `net.tcp.utils` : Register type logs

## Register types

To use the type from qml you need to register them. **NetTcp** also provide a qml debug namespace `NetTcp.Debug 1.0` that contain out of the box qml widget that are ready to use based on `Qaterial` library.

```c++
// Register types to QML
net::tcp::Utils::registerTypes();
// Load NetTcp.qrc
net::tcp::Utils::loadResources();
```

## Examples

An example that implement a client/server connection that exchange string is available in `examples` folder.

* `NetTcp_EchoServer` : Start a server that wait for client to connect and reply to the string they send.
* `NetTcp_EchoClient` : Connect to a server and send a string every 1 second.
* `NetTcp_EchoClientServer` : Implement both example into one executable.

```bash
> NetTcp_EchoClientServer -h

Options:
  -?, -h, --help    Displays this help.
  -t                Make the worker live in a different thread. Default false
  -s, --src <port>  Port for rx packet. Default "9999".
  -i, --ip <ip>     Ip address of multicast group. Default "127.0.0.1"
```

You can also check `NetTcp_EchoServer` that implement only the server code that reply echo to client that will connect.

And check `NetTcp_EchoClient`, example of a client that will connect to a server and send a string.
